--- Important Notice ---

Before we install RHACM operator we need to create pull secret for other K8S cluster.

Following article explains how to import an EKS cluster into RHACM but its also relevant for AKS:

Important to notice is that after we install ACM operator, AND! before we instantiate MultiClusterHub we must switch to the open-cluster-management namespace and create pull secret:

oc project open-cluster-management

oc create secret generic aks-secret \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=pull-secret.txt \
  --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson

as described in the article above, later creating MultiClusterHub in advanced options section we need to provide pull secret we just created.
